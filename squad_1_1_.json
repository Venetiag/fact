The Fetch car system is backed by the government and Milton Keynes Council and the goal is to make remote driving safer than actual driving. The tiny vehicles will not be autonomous and a human will control each one remotely from a control centre. People can order a ride by using a special app and the car will then be delivered to them. Already the vehicles have been tested out on private land and car parks around MK Stadium, and one of the first official journeys was to take MK Dons footballers in to work. MK Dons players and staff will also be taking part in the trials. Imperium Drive, the company behind the trials, says a “safety driver” will be in every vehicle in the initial stages of the trial. But eventually the cars will go alone, with computer image algorithms to detect anything that is nearby. Imperium chief executive Koosha Kaveh said: “There’s still a human involved, but they’ll be sitting in a control centre controlling the vehicle in the same way you would control a drone.” The head of transport innovation at Milton Keynes Council, Brian Matthews, said driverless cars will be commonplace in Milton Keynes within two years",

Thus connected vehicle technologies can potentially remedy data collection limitations of existing urban intersection managements, enhancing the performances of intersection controls such as reducing vehicle delay, reducing vehicle number of stops and improving energy efficiency.\"",
